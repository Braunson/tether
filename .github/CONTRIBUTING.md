# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tether! 

To encourage active collaboration, Tether strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. 
Pull requests will only be reviewed if there is a supporting test and all tests for new features are passing.

## Which Branch?

All pull requests should be sent to the `main` branch. Use a fork to create pull requests to `main`.

## Coding Style

Tether follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and 
the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard.

We also follow the [Laravel PHPDoc](https://laravel.com/docs/master/contributions#phpdoc) block syntax.

Don't worry you can use the lint command available in `composer.json` to format your code before create your pull requests. This allows you to focus on 
the content of the contribution and not the code style.

## Code of Conduct
The code of conduct is derived from the Ruby code of conduct. Any violations of the code of conduct may be reported to Percy Mamedy (percymamedy@gmail.com):

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behavior that can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
